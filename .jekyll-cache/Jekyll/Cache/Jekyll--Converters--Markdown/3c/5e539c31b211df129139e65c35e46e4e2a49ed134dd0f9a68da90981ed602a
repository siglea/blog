I"©<p>Recently Iâ€™m learning to create a Rails 5 api only application with an android mobile application. I want to send a activation email after user registered from the android app, and I found there is a free Mailgun add-on on Heroku. Itâ€™s perfect choice to start to play with because you can send up to 100 messages/hour without being charged. The documentation is good enough but I do found several steps confusing.</p>
