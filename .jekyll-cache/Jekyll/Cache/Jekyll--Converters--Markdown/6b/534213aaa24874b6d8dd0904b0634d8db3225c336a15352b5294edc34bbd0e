I"Ê<p>Days before, I changed the operating system of my old laptop from Windows7 to Ubuntu Desktop, I installed Ubuntu from a USB stick from my friend. After installing I found I Broadcom wireless driver wasnâ€™t installed so I couldnâ€™t connect to my WiFi. I tried several ways then found the solution, hope it my be helpful.</p>

<p>To download the driver from Internet, you need to connect with Ethernet.</p>

<p>Open Software and Update from system and configuration, open the fifth tab optional drivers and see if wireless driver comes out or not.</p>

<p>Make sure allowing downloading drivers from Internet is checked in the first tab Ubuntu Software.</p>

<p>If it still doesnâ€™t come out, you need to manually install it from terminal, use <code class="highlighter-rouge">lspci -nn -d 14e4:</code> command to see which network card youâ€™re using, then install the corresponding driver. <a href="http://askubuntu.com/questions/55868/installing-broadcom-wireless-drivers">http://askubuntu.com/questions/55868/installing-broadcom-wireless-drivers</a> offers an excellent guide.</p>
