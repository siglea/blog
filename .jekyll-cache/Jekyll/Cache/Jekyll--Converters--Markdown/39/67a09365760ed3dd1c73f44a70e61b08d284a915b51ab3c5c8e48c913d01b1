I"]<p>Recently I’m learning to create a Rails 5 api only application with an android mobile application. I want to send a activation email after user registered from the android app, and I found there is a free Mailgun add-on on Heroku. It’s perfect choice to start to play with because you can send up to 100 messages/hour without being charged. The documentation is good enough but I do found several steps confusing.</p>

<p>Firstly, you need to create a Mailgun account and add your credit card information, otherwise you can’t send to recipents other than authorized ones(which means test only).</p>

<p>Then, use the test domain(XXX@XXX.mailgun.org) to ensure Mailgun not being blocked by your test mail address(In my case I use qq mail at first, it actually blocks all traffic from mailgun). After that, you need to add a custom domain. Go to your domain name provider and configure DNS settings as following the steps of Mailgun instructions. In my case I use Namecheap and it took me a while(a cup of coffee) for Mailgun to verify my domain.</p>

<p>After your custom domain is active, configure your development environment and make sure it works. In my case I use smtp instead of api call, the settings are for example:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
  config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
	:address =&gt; "smtp.mailgun.org",
	:port =&gt; 587,
	:domain =&gt; mydomain.club',
	:user_name =&gt; "postmaster@mydomain.club",
	:password =&gt; XXXX
  }
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then start your rails server and see if the mail was delivered. I spent quite a few hours here because at first my emails weren’t delivered. I refered to the log and showed Mailgun accepted the mail address, and one minute later a ESP throttling message showed up. The reason is Mailgun being blocked by certain ISP(like qq mail, in this case I have to use an extra mail hosting service), so I couldn’t see any mail sent inbox.</p>

<p>If OK in development environemnt, change your production settings as well, it should work as well.</p>
